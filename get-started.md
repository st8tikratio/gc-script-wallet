- GraphQL Compose
- To feed Dingo into DGraph convert to JSON; can feed list into Dingo also
- DGraph is in Go
- Use binary iunstead of JSON where available
- SQL is very performant; for making backup volumes
  - put everything into Dingo, put graphQL onto and use plugins
    - plugins keep things lightweight
- Typescript node ->
- GCScript depends on the dapp being fully transparent about activities
- CIP-30 <-- What is it?

- UTXO v. Accounting Model -> anyway to convert metadata or specific fields to place in an accounting model or vis a vis.

- [Validator.js](https://github.com/GameChangerFinance/unimatrix/blob/master/examples/nodejs/src/validator.js), Unimatrix - essentially off-chain transaction 
- Unimatrix is a database and at least one node must be active
  - Relay peers must be online
  - If using required signing bots, they must be online as well
    - signing bots need to receive a transaction and submit a transaction
- private, secure, offline until submitted online 


## If artifact starts with gc, and the code came from onchain file iand not submitted by file owner the transaction will fail
